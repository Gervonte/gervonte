# 👋🏾 Hey, I'm **Gervonté Fowler**  
**Software Engineer • Founder, BuiltByGervonte LLC**  
🇧🇸 From **The Bahamas** | Based in the U.S.

## 🧭 What I’m Focused On  
I run **BuiltByGervonte LLC**, a hybrid engineering and creative studio built on intentional creation, clarity, and long-term stability.

Inside the company:  
- **Ignition Labs** (engineering and product studio focused on personal finance tools, currently in stealth)
- **DBTH Records** (creative and music division) 

On the engineering side, I’m working on:  
- full-stack product development  
- interview prep and coding-on-camera practice  
- rapid prototyping and iteration  
- internal tools and creative automation systems

### 🎨 Why I Build the Way I Build
Steve Jobs once noted that many of the best people at Apple were musicians, artists, and creatives  
*who also happened to be great at computer science.*

That idea resonates with me.  
My work sits at the intersection of engineering, creativity, and clarity. The same mindset shaping both Ignition Labs and DBTH Records.

This screenshot reflects what most of my late 2022 to 2024 journey looked like  
daily LeetCode, system design practice, and building projects while I was unable  
to find engineering roles back home. It became the foundation of my current  
engineering ability and the discipline behind everything I'm building today.
